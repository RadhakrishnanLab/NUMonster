<ul>
<li>
<b>'Early' protons:<p></b>
<ul><li>Monster is unable to assign a parent heavy atom to a proton, if the proton appears BEFORE the heavy atom in the PDB file.<p></li>
<li>The common example is that of terminal protons found at the beginning of the first residue, rather than after the last heavy atom in the same residue.<p></li>
<li>An implementation that derives all calculations and assignments residue-by-residue, rather than atom-by-atom, when reading in the ACF file, is planned.<p></li>
</ul>
