<P><CENTER><B>Explanation</B></CENTER></P><P>
<ul>
<li>An interaction 'passes' (green) when interactions occur in more than half the models, else it 'fails' to various degrees (red/orange/yellow).  This scheme was used to average out the bonds found in the different models, Monster found a large number of bonds unique to many of the models, so it was important to find bonds that appeared consistently across all models.<p></li>
<li>Empty/white fields indicate lack of ANY interaction.<p></li>
</ul>
</P><P><B><CENTER>Results</B></CENTER></P><P>
<ul>
<li>Only 12 out of the 83 residue pairings 'failed' in all three bond categories, ~90% success.<p></li>
<li>Monster did not find ANY interaction in ANY model in only ONE residue pairings. ~99% psuedo-success.<p></li>
<li>Almost all the hydrophobic interactions in both Trp 444 and Phe 459 'passed', apart from Phe 459-Phe 92, where hydrophobic interactions were found in only 12 models.<p></li>
<li>Two of the other three key residues, all basic, 'passed' with all contacts with Glu residues.  In addition, with Lys 456, the paper only lists, in Fig 2a, two hydrophobic residues.  However in the text, it states that all three probably interact with any of 4 specific Glu residues, please refer to the <A HREF="javascript:loadFrames('1ckkeiframes.html','1ckkeitext.html')">[Extra Interactions]</A> section for further reference.<p></li>

</P><P><B><CENTER>Conclusions</CENTER></B></P><P>
<ul>
<li>This was a testset in two ways:<ul>
<li>Monster testing: <br/>-We wanted to see how reliable Monster is.</li><ul>
<li>We conclude that in terms of finding interactions, Monster passed overwhelmingly. In only one suggested residue pairing, did Monster fail to find ANY interactions.<p></li>
</ul>
<li>Paper testing: <br/>-We wanted to see if Monster revealed more than stated in the paper.</li><ul>
<li>We conclude that the authors of the paper did find almost all important interactions as listed in the direct comparison.</li>
<li>In addition we conclude that, along with the suggestions with the text of the paper, the authors hardly missed any other important interactions.<p></li>
