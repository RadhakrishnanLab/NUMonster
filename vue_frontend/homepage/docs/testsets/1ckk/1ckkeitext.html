<ul>
<li>There are no 'failures' listed here.  This is because Monster found so many individual interactions, unique to only a few models, that they would throw no more light on this matter.<p></li>
<li>In their text, the authors suggested that residues Arg 455, Lys 456 and Arg 457 interacted with four specific Glutamines. They didn't reflect this in Fig 2a, where Lys 456 is only shown to interact with hydrophobic residues.  However, Monster found more electrostatic interactions, listed here for Arg 455 and Lys 456, confirming the suggestion.<p></li>
<li>For the other two key residues, each has extra hydrophobic interaction with other residues not listed. Regarding the large number of hydrophobic interactions already listed, and the stated purpose of these residues as hydrophobic anchors, it is not of import that these were 'missed'.<p></li>
<li>5 out of 10 new interactions belonged to 8 unimportant residues.<p></li>
