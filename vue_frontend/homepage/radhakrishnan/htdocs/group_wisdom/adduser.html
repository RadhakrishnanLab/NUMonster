<center><h2>How to Add/Remove a User to/from the RADLAB Domain</h2></center>
<center><h2>Adding Users</h2></center>
<p>It simply involves adding a user twice, once to the 'passwd' system, and once to the 'smbpasswd' system.
<p>This document assumes you are logged in as root.<p>Please make sure that the chosen username and password are at least 6 characters long and that the password starts with a capital letter.<p>
Both the commands below will ask for the chosen password TWICE.<p>
You may safely ignore any warnings, except ones related to the length of the password.<p>
<ul>
<li><pre>adduser <i>username</i> (note that the adduser command on Debian automatically prompts you to set the password on user creation)</pre><p></li> 
<li><pre>samba-tool user add <i>username</i> --must-change-at-next-login --rfc2307-from-nss </pre><p></li>
</ul>

<H3>Implications:</H3>
<ul>
<li>This is the same username and password, for both linux and windows<p></li>
<li>This username and password will now apply to every computer in the office (barring Maniatis/Scopes/Pauling)<p></li>
<li>The first time someone logs into Windows, their initial roaming profile will be created; also they will be asked to change their password<p></li>
<li>Upon logging into Windows, "Map the Network drive" under "Computer" in the Start menu by selecting the drive letter S: and typing \\monster2\<i>username</i><p></li>
<li>Everytime they log out of a windows machine, the profile will be DELETED FROM THAT MACHINE<p></li>
<li>Therefore upon initial log-in, change the target for the 'My Documents' folder on the Desktop to the S:\ drive by right-clicking on the icon and selecting Properties<p></li>
</ul>

<H3><blink>Bugs:</blink></H3>
<ul>
<li> An insidious error occurs with Samba when it fails to create a directory with the same name as username in the /home/samba/profiles directory.  A workaround is to create a directory with the same name and chown and chgrp'ing the directory to the username <p></li>
</ul>

<H3>Restoring pre-existing users:</blink></H3>
<ul>
To restore a pre-existing user (say to access their folders/files), do the following:<p>
<ul>
<li><pre>addgroup --gid xxxxx <i>username</i> </pre><p></li> 
<li><pre>adduser --uid xxxxx -gid xxxxx --disabled-login <i>username</i></pre><p></li>
</ul>
Now map their folder/drive: "\\monster2\<i>username</i>"<p>
Alternatively, map the drive: "\\monster2\people" which will give you access to all current and past users.<p>

<center><h2>Removing Users</h2></center>
To delete a user, delete the samba account first and THEN delete the unix account. Use the following command to delete the samba account: <pre>samba-tool user delete username</pre> This will not remove the directory or the files under /home/samba/profiles/username.  Delete the unix account using the command: <pre>userdel username</pre> This will not delete their home directory or the sub-directories/files.
