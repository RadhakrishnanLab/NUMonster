<p>The display manager used in RH9, XFree86 has been overlooked, or upgraded, depending on how you look at it, for Xorg.
<p>The configuration files for the two are similar, yet different so before you do upgrade RH9 do the following:

<ul><li>Make a copy of /etc/X11/XFree86-4.conf on the machine<p></li>
<li>Compare it to the <a href='xorg.conf'>xorg.conf template<a> from Overhauser<p></li>
<li>In the 'Section' called 'Device' in the XFree86-4.conf file, take note of the name of the 'Driver'<p></li>
</ul>

<p>If, when upgrading RH9 to RHEL, you have trouble with the display, make sure that the 'Driver' for the 'Device' is the <i>SAME NAME!</i>
<p>If there is no xorg.conf file, you should run <pre>Xorg</pre> to generate it automatically.  However, don't change the generated file unless you have problems.
