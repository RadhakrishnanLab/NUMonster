for expressing proteins in Minimal Media<br>
</b></h2>
Here are two alternative protocols that are likely to work well:<br>
[I] <br>
1. Transform bacteria in LB plate.<br>
2. Pick a colony (~1 mm in diameter) from the plate and streak a MM
plate.<br>
3. Pick a colony (at least ~0.5 mm in diameter) from MM plate and
inoculate liquid MM culture.<br>
<br>
[II]<br>
1. Streak a MM plate with a glycerol stock of already transformed
bacteria.<br>
2. Pick a colony (at least ~0.5 mm in diameter) from MM plate and
inoculate liquid MM culture.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Some practical tips: <br>
It takes about 36-48 h for discrete colonies to appear on MM plates
when grown at 37 deg C.&nbsp; Inoculate 100 ml MM cultures around at 8
or 9
PM and let them grow for 12 hours.&nbsp; The OD600 should be
~0.8.&nbsp;
Inoculate 1 liter cultures.&nbsp; The doubling time should be ~1
hour.&nbsp; The
key to getting high levels of expression in MM is to (a) keep bugs
growing constantly (i.e. do not transfer plates/liquid cultures to the
refrigerator at any stage) and (b) ensure that the OD600 is ideally
below 0.8 and definitely below 1.0.&nbsp; The latter is crucial because
after the exponential growth phase, bacteria enter a state of stasis
and are "too old" to make much protein.&nbsp; Growth kinetics (i.e.
doubling
times) are an excellent indicator of the health and happiness level of
bacteria (like your pulse rate and other vital signs), so be sure to
monitor this closely.&nbsp;
