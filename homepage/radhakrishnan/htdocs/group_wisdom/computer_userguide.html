<H3>Computers Overview</H3>

<p>The computers in the Radhakrishnan laboratory are split into two distinct groups easily defined by the rooms they are found in:
<ol type='1'>
<li>The "Lab" group:<p>
<ul>
<li>Maniatis (Windows NT)<p></li>
<li>Scopes (Windows NT)<p></li>
<li>Pauling (Windows 2000)<p></li>
</ul>
<p></li>
<li>The "Office" group:<p>
<ul>
<li>Purcell (Windows 2000/RedHat Enterprise Linux)<p></li>
<li>Dirac (Windows 2000/RedHat Enterprise Linux)<p></li>
<li>Hilbert (Windows 2000/RedHat Enterprise Linux)<p></li>
<li>Overhauser (Windows 2000/RedHat Enterprise Linux)<p></li>
<li>Slichter (Windows 2000/RedHat Enterprise Linux)<p></li>
<li>Abragam (SGI)<p></li>
</ul>
<p></li>
</ol>

<H2>*</H2>
<H3>The RADHAKRISHNAN Domain</H3>

<p>The log-in screen for windows has an extra option called 'Log in to:' which allows a user to select either 'this computer' or 'RADHAKRISHNAN'.
<p>The user will NOT be able to log in to 'this computer' as their username and password only exists in the RADHAKRISHNAN domain.
<p>If you get a login error, please double check this option, to make sure it says 'RADHAKRISHNAN'.

<H2>*</H2>
<H3>The 'H:\' Drive on Windows</H3>
<p>Logging in to the RADHAKRISHNAN domain automatically loads an extra disk drive called 'H:\'
<p>If you look in 'My Computer' (Right click->explore) you'll see something like this:

<p>"This drive is physically located on the file server that controls the RADHAKRISHNAN domain."

<p>This file server is automatically backed up on a regular basis, therefore it is important that you save all your precious data in the 'H:\' drive.

<H2>*</H2>
<H3>Roaming Profiles</H3>

<p>When a user logs in for the first time, the file server automatically creates a new roaming profile for that user.
<p>All the computers in the Office group will DELETE the profile when you log out, because it is saved on the file server.
<p>Therefore it is recommended that all files are saved in 'H:\'.
<p>Furthermore it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, that all users MOVE their 'My Documents' directory to 'H:\'.
<p>Here's how:
<ul><li>Right click on your 'My Documents' folder on the desktop, and click on 'properties'.<p></li>
<li>In the first tab ('Target') click on the 'Move' button, and then type 'H:\', and press return.<p></li>
<li>A pop-up will appear asking you if you want to move all the associated files, choose 'Yes'<p></li>
</ul>

<H2>*</H2>
<H3>Overview of Computers in the 'Lab' Group</H3>

<p>Each computer in the Lab group has it's own unique username, which is the same name as the computer's name. (e.g.: the username for Scopes is 'scopes').
<p>Never log on with your own username on these computers because you will not be able to access the data.
<p>Again, always log on into the RADHAKRISHNAN domain, with the sole exception of Pauling (see below)
<p>All data is saved (if possible) on the H:\ drive, which will only appear if you log in with the correct username.
<p>Please DO NOT save data anywhere else, if possible.
<p>Please DO NOT use these computers for personal use, including e-mail and/or internet.

<H4><i>Pauling/UV Solutions Complication</i></H4>

<p>UV Solutions has a bug that disables it from recognising the permissions of network users.
<p>Therefore, a local 'pauling' account is used instead (log onto 'Pauling (This computer)' instead of RADHAKRISHNAN).
<p>It is imperative that the user does NOT try to log onto the RADHAKRISHNAN domain using the user 'pauling'.
<p>The one main implication is that the profile is no longer saved onto monster.  So do NOT save any files/folders anywhere other than to H:\.

<H2>*</H2>
<H3>Accessing Other Lab Members' data</H3>

<p>One of the advantages of the windows network set-up is the ability to access anyone's data from any computer in the lab.
<p>In order to do this:
<ul>
<li>Right-click on 'My Computer' and choose 'Map network drive'.<p></li>
<li>in the drive path, type: '\\monster\<i>user</i>' where <i>user</i> is the username of the person whose data you want to access.<p></li>
<li>Press 'Finish'.<p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>It should be noted that you will only have read permissions on the newly mapped drive and will not be able to edit anyone else's data (thank goodness).
