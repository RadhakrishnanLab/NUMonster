In this example the PDB file 1UBQ was loaded via the <a href="http://monster.northwestern.edu/monster.jsp">monster web interface</a>
</LI>
<li>
In the parser applet, chain A was copied twice, into chain B and chain C, and then 'ignored'.
</li>
<li>
Chain B had its residue range set to 1-22
</li>
<li>
Chain C had its residue range set to 23-35
</li>
<li>
In the Chain Pairs tab, the one chain pair listed 'BC' was chosen, and the job was started.
</li>
<li>The results can be viewed through both the 2D bonds viewer, and the 3D webmol viewer(see left).<p></li>
