<li>The numbers show the total contact surface area for each of the residues in Chain B, and the percentage this is, of the total contact surface area of Chain B.<p></li>
<li>The highlighted residues are the key residues as mentioned in the paper.<p></li>
<li>The authors mentioned TRP 444 and PHE 459 as the key hydrophobic residues, and judging by their standings in the order of total contact surface area, number 1 and 2 respectively, the authors were right.<p></li>
<li>Looking at the percentages, the table also shows LYS 451 and LEU 454 to be of some importance too, as they are not far behind PHE 459.<p></li>
<li>Finally, despite their importance in terms of electrostatic interactions, the other three key residues don't do well in terms of contact surface area.  This serves to highlight that the information present in the table should only be addressed from a hydrophobic perspective.<p></li>
