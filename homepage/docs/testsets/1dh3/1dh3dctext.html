<LI><b>Paper:</b> J.Biol.Chem. Vol.275 #45 pp 35242-35247</LI>
<LI><b>Description:</b> CREB bZIP complexed with 8 base-pair DNA strand.</LI>
<LI><b>Residue List:</b> Derived from <i>CRE Binding Specificity</i> section of Results and Discusson. Extra interactions not mentioned in the text are referred to in the <A HREF="javascript:loadFrames('1dh3eiframe.html','1dh3eitext.html')">[Extra Interactions]</A> section.

<P><CENTER><B>Explanation</B></CENTER></P><P>
<ul>
<li>Due to the symmetry of the complex, Monster was not only scrutinised for accurate DNA-Protein interactions, but for symmetrical interactions too.<p></li>
<li>Green indicates that the interaction listed in the paper was found.<p></li>
</ul>
</P><P><B><CENTER>Results</B></CENTER></P><P>
<ul>
<li>Monster found all the listed interactions, including the specified asymmetric interactions involving Arg 301.<p></li>
<li>Monster found the specified TYPE of interactions involving ARG 301. Namely a water-mediated hydrogen bond to Ade -2 and a hydrogen bond to Gua 1.<p></li>
<li>Only one hydrogen bond between Arg 301 and Gua 1 was found, that involving the O6 of Gua 1. The paper also specified that a hydrogen bond should exist with the N7 too.</p></li>
<li>Monster found all listed interactions between opposite pairs, bar the asymmetric interactions.</li><ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</P><P><B><CENTER>Conclusions</CENTER></B></P><P>
<ul>
<li>We conclude that Monster passed overwhelmingly, both in finding the right DNA-Protein interactions, but also in finding the symmetrical interactions AND the asymmetrical interactions, bar one.<p></li>
