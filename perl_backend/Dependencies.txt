I typically PerlBrew to manage my perl installations:
https://metacpan.org/pod/App::perlbrew

But for NUMonster, we are using system perl

I use cpanm to manage my perl packages:
https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus
https://perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html

You will need to make sure your SSL libraries are up to date, I use openssl

Perl dependencies (asterix denotes requirement in NUMonster, to date):
*File::Stream
*XML::LibXML
*Excel::Writer::XLSX

(Untested in NUMonster)
Net::SSLeay
HTTP::Daemon::SSL
XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP
Carp
Net::SMTP
IO::Uncompress::Gunzip
IO::File
DBI
